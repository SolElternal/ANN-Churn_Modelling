# ANN-Churn_Modelling
 The "ANN-Churn_Modelling" project uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict customer churn, helping businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.
 
The "ANN-Churn_Modelling" project focuses on using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn for a bank. By inputting customer data such as demographics, account details, and financial behavior, the model estimates whether a customer is likely to leave the bank. This helps businesses take proactive measures to retain valuable customers by identifying potential churn risks based on various factors like credit score, age, account balance, and membership status. The exam scenario involves predicting whether a specific customer, given their details, will churn or stay with the bank.
